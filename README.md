stackGAN not completed implementation in the web

1) Thanks to the official gitHub repository of stackGAN-v1 on Tensorflow 


@inproceedings{han2017stackgan,
Author = {Han Zhang and Tao Xu and Hongsheng Li and Shaoting Zhang and Xiaogang Wang and Xiaolei Huang and Dimitris Metaxas},
Title = {StackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks},
Year = {2017},
booktitle = {{ICCV}},
}

2) Code presented in my realization is the extension of code: https://github.com/AarohiSingla/StackGAN.git 
3) Dataset was taken from ZHOU Yutong, FFHQ-Text Dataset - https://github.com/Yutong-Zhou-cv/FFHQ-Text_Dataset.git


Results:
  unprocessed text - "This woman turns her face towards the front side. \nThis woman is about 38 to 43 years old and has narrow light-brown eyes with double eyelids"
  
  image generated - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66064451/176171190-10b70a14-d886-4007-99aa-ae87254342a1.png)



Further steps:
 1) Improve embedding and try out Dataset with more samples 
 2) Deploy to paperspace
 3) Connect files to Deta drive 
 4) User profile
 5) Company profile
